# ADR: Introduce CQRS + Event Sourcing to the Prompt Domain

## Status

## Context
The current `Prompt` domain uses a static structure with Value Objects. However, it faces several issues:

- Invariants such as keyword length and state transition integrity are not strictly enforced within the domain.
- The Application layer is bloated due to the mixture of use case logic, UI state management, and persistence concerns.
- There is no way to track how a `Prompt` has changed over time, making it difficult to support audit logs or rollback features.

## Decision
We will redesign the Prompt domain as follows:

- Adopt **CQRS** to clearly separate command and query responsibilities.
- Introduce **Event Sourcing** to reconstruct state from a stream of domain events.
- `PromptAggregate` will expose pure functions for state transitions and return the corresponding `DomainEvent`s.
- Events will be persisted through an `EventStore` interface (initially implemented as `InMemoryEventStore`).
- A separate `PromptReadModel` will be constructed for queries to ensure read performance.

## Consequences
- Since we store events instead of state, reconstructing the current state becomes more costly. This will be mitigated by introducing snapshots in the future.
- Command handling logic will become more complex, but the domain gains traceability, auditability, and analytical capability.
- EventStore design for NoSQL systems like DynamoDB will be required in a later phase.

## Implementation (Phase 0)
- Implement `PromptAggregate.createPromptAggregate()` as a pure function.
- Define `PromptCreated` event as the first domain event.
- Introduce `InMemoryEventStore` with `append()` and `load()` functions.
- Provide `replayPrompt(events)` to reconstruct the state from events.
- Plan to extend with additional events such as `PromptRenamed`, `PromptBodyRewritten`, etc.
