1. Fundamental Principles

1.1 Functional Programming (FP)
- Pure Functions First: Prioritize pure functions to minimize side effects.
- Immutable Data Structures: Use immutable data to prevent state mutations.
- Separation of Side Effects: Isolate I/O operations and external API calls within dedicated infrastructure layers.
- Type Safety: Leverage TypeScript’s type system (e.g., branded types) to enforce strict domain language.

1.2 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Clear Distinction between Value Objects and Entities: Identify entities by unique identifiers, while value objects are compared based on their intrinsic values.
- Aggregates for Consistency: Use aggregates to encapsulate and enforce business invariants.
- Repository Pattern: Abstract data persistence behind repositories to separate domain logic from storage details.
- Bounded Contexts: Define and enforce clear interfaces between modules to reduce coupling.

1.3 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Adopt the Red-Green-Refactor Cycle: Write tests first, implement functionality, then refactor.
- Unit, Integration, and End-to-End Tests: Cover all layers by isolating business logic and using mocks/stubs for external dependencies.
- Assert-First Approach: Define expected outcomes early to drive design and error handling.


2. Implementation Patterns and Type Design

2.1 Type Definitions with TypeScript
- Use branded types to define explicit domain types and enhance type safety.

```ts
// Example: Branded Types for Enhanced Type Safety
type Branded<T, B> = T & { _brand: B };
type Money = Branded<number, "Money">;
type Email = Branded<string, "Email">;

// Result type to clearly represent success and failure states
type Result<T, E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E };
```

2.2 Value Objects
- Enforce immutability.
- Self-validate and encapsulate domain-specific logic.

```ts
// Creating a validated Money value object with self-contained logic
function createMoney(amount: number): Result<Money, Error> {
  if (amount < 0) return { ok: false, error: new Error("Negative amount is not allowed") };
  return { ok: true, value: amount as Money };
}
```

2.3 Entities and Aggregates
- Design entities with unique IDs and controlled state updates.
- Manage changes through well-defined aggregate roots ensuring consistency.


1. Infrastructure Layer and Adapter Pattern

3.1 Repository Abstraction
- Create repositories that isolate domain models from persistence logic.
- Support interchangeable implementations (e.g., in-memory for testing and DynamoDB for production).

3.2 Adapter Pattern
- Abstract external dependencies (APIs, databases) behind interfaces.
- Facilitate easy replacements and testing by injecting mock adapters.


4. Implementation Process and Coding Guidelines

4.1 Development Process
1. Define Domain Models: Start with domain-specific types, value objects, entities, and use cases.
2. Implement Pure Functions: Write and test business logic functions that have no side effects.
3. Isolate Side Effects: Confine I/O operations, API calls, and database interactions to separate layers.
4. Implement Adapters: Abstract external integrations with interfaces to allow seamless substitutions.

4.2 Code Style Guidelines
- Function-Centric Development: Use functions over classes unless necessary.
- Immutable Update Patterns: Favor spread operators and object destructuring to create new state instances.
- Early Returns: Simplify conditional logic by returning early, reducing nesting.
- Explicit Error Handling: Define clear error types and use enumerations for use case-specific errors.

4.3 Component Architecture (Presentation-Container Pattern)
- Presentation Components: Pure components focused solely on UI rendering.
- Container Components: Manage business logic and side effects; integrate state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Recoil) when required.


5. Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance

5.1 Unit Testing
- Emphasize testing of pure functions and core business logic.
- Thoroughly verify both successful outcomes and error conditions using the Result type.

5.2 Integration Testing
- Test the interaction between repositories and the infrastructure layer.
- Validate interactor layers that drive complete business scenarios.

5.3 End-to-End Testing
- Simulate real-world usage flows to ensure that the UI, API communication, and data layers work in tandem correctly.


6. Business Value and Future Scalability

6.1 Value Proposition
- Enhanced Productivity: Enable rapid prompt execution and efficient local management.
- Increased Collaboration: Facilitate knowledge sharing through centralized prompt repositories and utilization dashboards.
- Strategic Insights: Empower decision-making with data-driven analytics on prompt usage and interactions.

6.2 Scalability and Flexibility
- Begin with an internal organizational focus and design for future expansion towards global markets.
- Iterate functionality based on continuous feedback (UAT, beta testing) to adapt to evolving business requirements.


7. Operational and Release Strategy
- Staged Deployment: Roll out initial alpha builds for internal testing, progress to beta for broader evaluations, and finalize with a full-scale release.
- Continuous Maintenance: Implement regular bug fixes, security updates, and performance monitoring to ensure reliable operation.
